# Background Information

A comparitive table of jōyō kanji, tradional Chinese characters and simplified Chinese characters may be found at [this drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_v5DhUsRRWgeXFINWRRM1BUTjA/view), linked to from this [blog post](http://taretz.blogspot.com/2008/07/3000-most-frequently-used-chinese.html).
It contains 1945 kanji and information regarding the corresponding Chinese characters.

This table has not been updated to match the late 2010 revision of the jōyō kanji, in which 196 characters were added and 5 characters were removed, for a total of 2136 characters.
